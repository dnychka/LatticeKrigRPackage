Description: Methods for the interpolation of large spatial
  datasets. This package follows a "fixed rank Kriging" approach but
  provides a surface fitting method
  that can approximate standard spatial data models.
  Using a large number of basis functions allows for estimates that
  can come close to interpolating the observations (a spatial model
  with a small nugget variance.)  Moreover, the covariance model for
  this method can approximate the Matern covariance family but also
  allows for a multi-resolution model and supports efficient
  computation of the profile likelihood for estimating covariance
  parameters. This is accomplished through compactly supported basis
  functions and a Markov random field model for the basis
  coefficients. These features lead to sparse matrices for the
  computations and this package makes of the R spam package for sparse
  linear algebra.
  An extension of this version over previous ones ( < 5.4 ) is the
  support for different geometries besides a rectangular domain. The
  Markov random field approach combined with a basis function
  representation makes the implementation of different geometries
  simple where only a few specific R functions need to be added with
  most of the computation and evaluation done by generic routines that
  have been tuned to be efficient.  One benefit of this package's
  model/approach is the facility to do unconditional and conditional
  simulation of the field for large numbers of arbitrary points. There
  is also the flexibility for estimating non-stationary covariances
  and also the case when the observations are a linear combination
  (e.g. an integral) of the spatial process. Included are generic
  methods for prediction, standard errors for prediction, plotting of
  the estimated surface and conditional and unconditional simulation.

  package.
